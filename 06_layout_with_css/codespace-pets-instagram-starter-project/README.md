# Learning Reflections README 

This project was a bit challenging for me. There was a lot of new information to learn. I will continue to practice so that I can understand it better.

#### Areas of Mastery

I am comfortable with creating buttons, pulling and pushing to github. I master adding colours. The advanced CSS is what I have not mastered as yet. I know a little of the grid, I master translation and animation. I also master hover effects.
 

#### Challenges Faced

I still need to practice on aligning my subheadings and look out for the syntax errors.
I did not get to have my project to look like the isntagram outline.



#### Areas for Improvement
Practice more on advanced CSS.


#### Overall Learning Experience

My overall experience so far has been exciting. I am enjoying learning the basis to software delopment programme. I am exted to know more and practice. Master it.
